In parallel, I managed project plans, risks, and status updates for a 20+‑member cross‑functional team using Jira, MS Project, and Smartsheet. Post–go‑live, I collaborated with DevOps to triage bugs, lead root‑cause analyses, and prioritize fixes.

I owned configuration within SAP Concur—designing rules‑based workflows to enforce policy—and extended Oracle EBS PO/AP/GL/AR modules to ingest and reconcile Concur data. I managed batch‑processing integrations, validating exports/imports and automating reconciliations to achieve complete alignment on spend, commitments, and accruals. To ensure quality, I defined the SDLC phases, developed UAT test scripts, facilitated QA cycles, and provided post‑deployment support.
